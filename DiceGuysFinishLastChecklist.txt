DiceGuysFinishLast Ideas
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Find common/uncommon weapons lying around the map. When killing
  a mini-boss you could obtain some sort of weapon as well or even a D20
  to use in the dice dome.

- Random events can occur, if the DM wants it to happen.(Randomly occurs 
  Possibly a roll check. For example, if DM rolls higher than a 15 then 
  a powerful enemy will appear, or possibly ammo rains from the sky.

- The players can find dice drops (D-20) and roll the dice. Depending
  on the value of the roll, the player will either get a high-tier 
  weapon or a low-tier weapon. Dice value example for weapon tiers:
  1 = common -- 2-5 = common or uncommon -- 6-10 = uncommon or rare --
  11-15 = rare or epic -- 16-19 = epic or legendary --
  20 = legendary.

- If a player is having bad luck on dice rolls (anything lower than 5)
  the player will get a bad luck streak and recieve a coin to flip, if
  it lands on whatever they choose (heads or tails) they will recieve
  a rare - legendary weapon. If it lands on the oppossite they recieve
  a common or uncommon weapon.

- Health pick-ups will be on the ground in a flask or food.
  (or something more creative).

- Overshield pick-ups will be a pair of dice(6d with heart logos)
  you can find around the level and with it you can roll the dice and 
  gain however much overshield the dice landed on. Ex: dice lands on
  heart thats half colored in, you recieve half of what an overshield
  can give.

- Characters are selected in the beginning by using a menu full of
  character sheets. The characters are presets and have no different
  attributes, just cosmetics and personality. 

- Fall damage is non-existant so we can have an even higher mobility
  threshold whereas having fall damage would counteract some high
  mobility traits.

- When you recieve dice you throw it into a dice dome (popper), and
  then like the board game trouble you pop the dice in the dome. When that
  happens a digital counter on the dome will tell you the roll you got,
  and depending on the rarity of the weapon will be an effect that occurs
  when your gun is being spawned in the game.

Ideas that are a indefinite
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Players can pick up dice that give power-ups to characters. Such as
  movement speed, increased damage, increased health or something along
  those lines.

- Players can pick up passive items in the game that alter their stats.
